# Quantum Gates Project

## Overview
This project explores the implementation and simulation of quantum gates, which are the fundamental building blocks of quantum computing. It is part of a structured quantum learning path focused on building practical understanding step-by-step.

## What Are Quantum Gates?
Quantum gates are operations that act on qubits, analogous to classical logic gates in traditional computing. Unlike classical gates, quantum gates leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations.

### Key Quantum Gates
- **Pauli-X Gate**: Flips the state of a qubit (like a NOT gate in classical computing).
- **Hadamard Gate (H)**: Places a qubit into a superposition state.
- **CNOT Gate**: A two-qubit gate that flips the second qubit if the first qubit is in the |1‚ü© state.
- **Phase Gates (S, T)**: Introduce phase shifts to the qubit's state.
- **Toffoli Gate**: A three-qubit gate used for reversible classical computation.
